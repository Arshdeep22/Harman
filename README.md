INTRODUCTION
In this era of advancement, automating the boring stuff and analyzing the public routines and using that for providing services is one of the burning topics. With the development of Artificial Intelligence, it is immensely used for automation and analysis. This project will help the uses to automate some regular like opening applications, logging into accounts, weather reports, getting summary and twitter sentiment analysis. With the use of various libraries and different API’s(Google Speech-to-Text, Tweepy, OpenWeatherMap API) of python and  machine learning, we will automate and perform twitter sentiment analysis. We will show the visualization of data of final report after tweet sentiment analysis in pie chart with the help of python language(matplotlib). This whole thing is done with the voice commands, user just have to speak what he wants to do HARMAN will perform that task. HARMAN has its own voice which make the user feel good that he is interacting, rather than just giving commands.
FEATURES:

1.	Twitter Sentiment analysis:  

Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.

2.	Automation:

•	Logging into profiles:
We can use python for web scraping. HARMAN will open the web browser and login into the Facebook or Gmail account of the user (Email and password pre-given in the code). User just have to say “Open Facebook/Gmail”, “Log in into my Facebook/Gmail account” etc., rest of the work will be done by HARMAN (like opening that particular website, filling email and password).   

•	Weather report:
HARMAN can show the weather report of particular city, user just have to tell the city name. For example, user can speak “How’s the weather in Amritsar?”,” Show me weather of Amritsar” etc. With the help of OpenWeatherMap API it will display the weather report of that city.

•	Topic summary:
One of most difficult work is to get a concise and detailed summary of any topic. With the help of Wikipedia module, we can get summary of any topic very easily, user just have to say for example “Give me summary of India”, “Show summary of elections”. 

•	Launching basic applications:
User can open basic computer applications like paint, notepad, word etc. by just speaking the application name after open. For example, “Open notepad”, “open calculator” etc.

•	Birthday Reminder:
HARMAN will remind the user if today there is birthday of any person whose birthday is already told to HARMAN. User can also add new person’s birthday just with the voice command.
